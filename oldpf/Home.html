In the spirit of being grateful, I thought I might start a new tradition. Here is my list of things I am grateful for in the technology space:<br /><br />

I'm thankful that we get to live in a golden age where every piece of knowledge you can imagine, the greatest library in history, is available at all times to everyone. I'm thankful that roughly 50% of the urban population this country now carries laptops everywhere, and that we don't even think it's a big deal any more. I'm not necessarily thankful that work can reach me anywhere, but I am thankful that I can theoretically do nearly all my work from anywhere.<br />

I'm thankful that I have creative tools in my pocket that would make Leonardo da Vinci weep, and I'm thankful that I occasionally have the wit to use them, rather than just sitting back and letting the content come to me.<br />

I'm thankful that I can freely express any opinion in any one of a thousand forums, instantly, globally. I'm thankful for my Twitter followers and for those I'm following, and that they labor all day to keep me amused and informed without receiving a single penny in compensation. I'm thankful for my Facebook friends, who help and encourage and cajole and tease and share and point me towards the light when I'm in a dark place.<br />

I'm thankful for Instagram, and for the fact that there are a million artfully filtered pictures of everyone's good time being posted to phones across India right now.<br />

I'm thankful for the iPhone, I'm thankful for Android, I'm thankful they made a decent Windows Phone, and I'm thankful that there is real competition between them. I'm really thankful we won't see a repeat of the Microsoft monopoly of the 1990s. I'm thankful that the Galaxy SIII recently became the most popular smartphone; maybe it'll spur Apple to make an even more innovative iPhone 5S.<br />
I'm thankful for e-books. I'm thankful for the fact that I'm reading more than ever because of them, despite the naysayers who claim technology is dumbing us down. I'm thankful that tablets single-handedly saved the comics business. I'm thankful that artists have so many channels to distribute their content without the middlemen, so those middlemen can go off and become artists themselves.<br />
Most of all, I'm thankful that anything we might decide to argue about over this post can be settled with a simple search. And I'm thankful that any time I get tired of my real family, I can go take a quick time out with my Internet family, and because of that break I can come back and be once again grateful for your presence, your proximity, your warmth.
