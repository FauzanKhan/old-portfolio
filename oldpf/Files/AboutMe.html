    <div id="content">I'm a 3rd Year <em>Computer Science & Engineering</em> student at <b><a href="http://www.mtu.ac.in" style="color:black">Mahamaya Technical University</a></b> with interest in web designing and software development.<br />I've got decent knowledge of website designing and a few programming languages including <em>Java</em> and <em> C/C++ </em>.I also find myself quite goot at <em>HTML</em> and <em>CSS</em> and pretty much know the basics of <em>jQuery</em> and <em>JavaScript</em>.<br />
    I've been playing around with <em>HTML</em>, <em>CSS</em> and <em>jQuery</em> for quite some time now and I'm ready to apply the knwoledge of these languages to build something more innovative and useful than what I've already built. To be precise, I'm looking for an internship or a part time job where I can use my knowledge of the languages I've mentioned, further increase my understanding about these languages and enhance my web designing and programming skills. <br />I aspire to become an expert IT professional one day, I'm learning and practicing everyday to fulfill this aspiration of mine. <br />I look forward to have some industrial exposure and understanding of how things work around in the IT sector before stepping out in the industry as a graduate.
